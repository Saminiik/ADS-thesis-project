### **Athey, S., Keleher, N., & Spiess, J. (2025)**
- Compares causal targeting with predictive targeting using a machine learning approach in a financial aid renewal field experiment.
- Finds that causal targeting can more effectively identify students whose behavior is likely to change as a result of an intervention.
- Emphasizes the practical value of combining machine learning with experimental design to improve policy efficiency.

- Explores the heterogeneous effects of job loss on earnings across individual workers, firms, and labor markets.
- Uses a large dataset from Sweden and a machine learning model to estimate these heterogeneous impacts.
- Shows that worker-level characteristics alone are insufficient to capture full heterogeneity—firm and market-level factors are also crucial.

Karlan et al. (2014): Agricultural Decisions after Relaxing Credit and Risk Constraints

This study investigates the impact of providing rainfall index insurance and cash grants to farmers in northern Ghana. The key findings include:

Insurance vs. Cash Grants: Farmers who received rainfall index insurance increased their agricultural investment by 13%, whereas those who received cash grants showed relatively small changes in investment behavior.

Risk as a Constraint: The results suggest that uninsured risk is a more significant constraint on agricultural investment than liquidity constraints. Providing insurance enabled farmers to allocate more resources to their farms, highlighting the role of risk mitigation in promoting investment.
